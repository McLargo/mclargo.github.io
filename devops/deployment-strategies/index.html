    <h1 id="deployment-strategies">Deployment strategies</h1>
<p>How to deploy your application in production is a crucial decision. Depending on
your needs, you can choose from several deployment strategies. But ideally, what
you want is to deploy your application with zero downtime. This means that your
application is always available to users, even when you are deploying new
features or fixing bugs.</p>
<h2 id="blue-green-deployment">Blue-green deployment</h2>
<p>In a blue-green deployment, you have two identical environments. One is the
blue, which contains the current version of your application and it is serving
real users. The other is green, which contains the new version deployed. Once
validation is completed, you switch the router to point to the green environment
and start sending user traffic to the environment. This way, you can deploy your
application with zero downtime.</p>
<p>Once the green environment is live, you can keep the blue environment as a
backup, or terminate it to save costs.</p>
<h2 id="canary-deployment">Canary deployment</h2>
<p>In a canary deployment, you deploy a new version of your application to a small
group of users. This gives you a live environment where you can monitor and test
the new app while minimizing the impact to the user base.</p>
<p>If the canary deployment is successful, you can gradually increase the traffic
to the new version until it is fully deployed.</p>
<h2 id="rolling-deployment">Rolling deployment</h2>
<p>In a rolling deployment, you gradually replace instances of the old version of
your application with the new version. This continues until all instances are on
the new version.</p>
<h2 id="ab-testing">A/B testing</h2>
<p>In A/B testing, you deploy two versions of your application to different groups
of users. This allows you to compare the performance of the two versions and
make data-driven decisions about which version to keep.</p>
