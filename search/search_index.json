The sender sends the message and continues with its own processing. The receiver receives the message and processes it. The receiver can then send an ACK response message to the sender, which can be processed by the sender. This is used in microservices architectures to decouple services and applications. A key concept in asynchronous communication is that messages consumption must be idempotent , meaning that the same message can be processed multiple times without causing unintended side effects, and keeping the system in the same state. There are two main messaging patterns: message queuing and publish/subscribe. Message queuing Multiple producers can send message to the same queue, but once the message is consumed, is removed. Only one consumer consume a specific message. Publish/subscribe Multiple producers can publish a message to a topic, and several consumers can subscribe to the same topic, consuming and handle the message in different ways. Messages can be ephemeral or durable. Used for event-driven architecture . Usually the message have a schema, which is the contract defined between producers and consumers. Json and Avro are some of the most common formats used to define the schema. Tools RabbitMQ RabbitMQ supports classic message queuing out of the box. A developer defines named queues, and then publishers can send messages to that named queue. Consumers, in turns, use the same queue to retrieve messages to process them. Apache Kafka Kafka doesn\u2019t implement the notion of a queue. Instead, Kafka stores collections of records in categories called topics . Topics can be partitioned, allowing multiple consumers to read from the same topic in parallel. Topics have a retention policy, which means that messages are not deleted immediately after being consumed. Instead, they are kept for a certain period of time and in some scenarios, forever. So all messages can be consumed again by moving the consumer offset to the desired position of the topic.

RESTful web services allow clients to access and manipulate resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. It is commonly used to build RESTful Apis. Design/develop good API from starters is important, as they can grow quickly and it is hard to change them later. Also, new developers can have a quicker ramp up to the project. RESTful API Making Requests Rest requires the client to send a request to the server to execute an action. A request is made up of: HTTP verb, which defines what kind of operation to perform. headers, which allows the client to pass along information about the request. path to a resource, including any identifiers. query parameters (optional). message/payload containing data (optional). HTTP Verbs There are 4 basic HTTP verbs (commonly called CRUD) used in requests: GET: retrieve a specific resource (by id) or a collection of resources POST: create a new resource PUT: update a specific resource (by id) DELETE: remove a specific resource by id Headers and Accept parameters In the header of the request, you can specify the type of data you want to send or receive. Or any other metadata you want to pass along with the request, such as authentication token. Path A path to the resource you want to interact with. It is a string that follows the URL. It can contain identifiers for the resource you want to access, such as /users/123 to access the user with id 123. Query Parameters Query parameters are optional and are used to filter, sort, or paginate the results. Message/Payload The message is the data you want to send to the server. It can be in different formats, such as JSON, XML, or form data. The format send is specified in the headers. Responses Content Types When the server sends a response, it includes a content type header that tells the client what kind of data is being sent. HTTP Status Code There are several HTTP status codes that the server can send back to the client. They are divided into ranges: 2XX -> success codes range 200 OK 201 Created 202 Accepted 204 No Content 3XX -> redirect codes range 4XX -> client error codes range 400 Bad Request 401 Unauthorized 403 Forbidden 404 Not Found 405 Method Not Allowed 409 Conflict 422 Unprocessable Entity 429 Too Many Requests 5XX -> server error codes range But, HTTP status codes are not enough to explain what went wrong. To help your API consumers, include a structured JSON error message, like: Error code: A machine-readable error code that identifies the specific error condition. Error message: A human-readable message that provides a detailed explanation of the error. Error context: Additional information related to the error, such as the request ID, the request parameters that caused the error, or the field(s) in the request that caused the error. Error links: URLs to resources or documentation that provide additional information about the error and how it can be resolved. Timestamp: The time when the error occurred. Good practices RESTful API parametrize your API endpoints to version them. e.g. /api/v1/users . group your endpoints by resources and scopes (e.g. /api/v1/users , /api/v1/admin/users ). resources in plural. e.g. /users , /products use - instead of _ . don't use verbs, use names. Actions are implicit in HTTP methods. keep naming consistency across your API (paths, query parameters, payload, response...). validate your inputs and outputs. secure your API with authentication and authorization. use pagination for large datasets. document your API. Tools like OpenAPI can help you to document your API in a standard way. usage of Enum type instead of bool for query parameters. public id should be UUID instead of an integer. More secure and less predictable. don't expose internal database structure in your API. log each request with unique request ID. create common error response. GET ALL `api/<resources>` HTTP status code 200 OK for a successful GET of resource, or empty results. It should include pagination by default. GET BY ID `api/<resources>/<id>` HTTP status code 200 OK for a successful GET of resource. HTTP status code 404 KO for a KO GET of a not found resource. POST `api/<resources>` If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location header (see section 14.30). PUT `api/<resources>/<id>` HTTP status code 200 OK for a successful PUT of an update to an existing resource. No response body needed. (Per Section 9.6, 204 No Content is even more appropriate.) HTTP status code 400 Bad Request for an unsuccessful PUT, with natural-language text (such as English) in the response body that explains why the PUT failed. (RFC 2616 Section 10.4) Secrets Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories. If a secret enters a repository, private or public, then it should be considered compromised. Add sensitive files in .gitignore Store secrets safely. Encrypting your secrets using common tools, such as git secret. Storing them within a git repository can be beneficial when working in teams as it keeps secrets synced. A better solution is to use a \"Secrets as a service\", such as AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, infiscal , Google Secrets Manager...and forget about secrets management. Good to implement a secret rotation policy. This is a good practice to avoid security issues. Finally, in pre-commit you can add a hook to check if there are secrets in the code you are trying to push to the repository.

No matter what approach is used, if Orchestration or Choreography , both can use an Event-driven architecture to communicate with the difference services involved. Events are trigger from services and other services can subscribe to them, and react upon the event information. Communication between services using events is asynchronous . Core components of event-driven architecture The core components of an EDA are: Producer: upstream service that generates events and publishes them to the event broker. Consumers: one or more downstream services that subscribe to events from the event broker. Brokers: a message broker that receives events from producers, storage them and delivers them to consumers. Each event might be delivered to one or more consumers. Events An event is a message that represents a change in state or an action in the system. All events are messages, but not all messages are events. Usually are represented in a key/value format, where the key is the event type that identifies the event and the value is the event payload, which contains the information about the event. Events are immutable. Once an event is published, it can't be changed. If a change is needed, a new event must be published with new data. You can rebuild your entire system state by replaying the events. Domain events A domain event is, something that happened in the domain that you want other parts of the same domain (in-process) to be aware of. More into details, we can distinguish between: Events represent a past, something that already happened and can\u2019t be undone. Commands, on the other hand, represent a wish, an action in the future which can be rejected. Database events Changes in database can also be used as events. For example, a database trigger when a row is inserted, updated or deleted, called CDC (Change Data Capture). Event producers Event producer are the part of the system that generates events and publishes them to the event broker. They can be any part of the system, like a service, a database, a user interface, etc. It decides when to publish an event, serialize the event in the corresponding format and send it to the event broker. Events can be transmitted immediately, or in batched mode, depending on the configuration of the event producer. Event broker It's an immutable log of events. It receives events from producers and stores them. The event broker is responsible for delivering events to consumers. Event stream An event stream will be a sequence of events that are related to each other. It can be consumed by multiple consumers. Consumers can read the events in the stream in the order they were published, as many times as they want (in case consumer crashes and needs to recover to get the last picture). Messages can be deleted from the stream after a certain period of time, or after a certain number of messages. Kafka or Pulsar are examples of event brokers that support event streams. Event queue Traditional message queues are used to deliver messages to a single consumer. Once a message is consumed, it's removed from the queue. Multiple consumers consume different messages from the queue. RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ are examples of event brokers that support event queues. Event consumers Event consumers are the part of the system that subscribes to events from the event broker. In case of event stream, each consumer will have a offset to know which event has been read (offset is the position of the last event read, and can be updated).

Microservices architecture breaks down an application into smaller, independent services that each serve a specific business capability or function. These services are developed and deployed independently, often with their own codebase and database. Principles Independent development and scaling of individual services. Developers can work on small, focused teams, and each service can be scaled independently based on its specific requirements and on demand, making resource allocation more efficient. Each microservice can se different technology stacks and databases for each service, depending on the requirements. This flexibility allows you to choose the best tool for each job. Microservices can be deployed independently, making it easier to implement CI/CD pipelines for each service. This results in faster and more frequent deployments with less risk. More resilient than a monolithic system. If one service fails, it doesn't necessarily impact the entire system, as long as other services can continue to function. Managing the interactions between multiple services can introduce complexity in terms of service discovery, communication, and monitoring. Orchestration Orchestration is an approach where one of the services acts as the coordinator and orchestrator of the overall distributed state change, managing the execution of tasks or services It defines the order and flow of activities and often involves a central point of control that dictates what should happen next. The orchestrator is responsible for making decisions and ensuring that each component of the system performs its tasks in the prescribed sequence. It can be simpler to design and implement for relatively small-scale systems with a limited number of components. However, as the system grows in complexity, the central orchestrator can become a bottleneck and may make the system less scalable and more challenging to maintain. It is easier to implement fault tolerance and error handling because the central orchestrator can monitor the execution of tasks and react to failures by rerouting or retrying steps. It also provides a central point for monitoring and logging, making it easier to track the progress of tasks and diagnose issues. There is less direct communication between services since most interactions are mediated by the orchestrator. This can reduce the need for services to be aware of each other's existence. Choreography Choreography is an approach of service coordination where participants exchange events without a centralized point of control. With this pattern, each service performs a local transaction and publishes events that trigger local transactions in other services. Each component of the system participates in decision-making about a business transaction's workflow, instead of relying on a central point of control. The interaction and coordination between services are determined by a set of predefined rules or contracts. There is no single point of control, and the overall behavior of the system emerges from the interactions between the participating components. It can be more suitable for large-scale and complex distributed systems because it distributes the decision-making and control among individual components. As new services are added or existing ones are modified, the system can remain more flexible and scalable. However, choreographed systems can be harder to visualize and debug, especially as the number of interactions between services increases. Also, relies on the individual services to handle errors and failures gracefully, making it more challenging to ensure consistent error-handling strategies across the entire system. It may require more advanced monitoring and tracing tools to gain insights into the interactions between services and to identify bottlenecks or errors. Finally, it requires services to communicate directly with each other, which can lead to more inter-service communication. This increased communication can result in more complex service discovery and network traffic management. Architecture styles Services in a microservice architecture needs to communicate between each other. There are different architectural styles to achieve this communication: REST : Representational State Transfer is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. RESTful services are stateless, meaning that each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request. REST is simple to understand and implement, and it can be used over any protocol that supports request/response semantics.

A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Uses of design patterns Utilizing design patterns in the development process can accelerate progress by offering tried-and-tested development models. Effective software design necessitates the consideration of issues that may only surface during later implementation stages. The utilization of design patterns aids in mitigating subtle problems that can lead to significant complications, and it enhances code readability for developers and architects who are acquainted with these patterns. These design patterns offer general solutions, presented in a format that is not bound to specific problems. They serve as templates or blueprints for structuring code to address specific challenges. Furthermore, design patterns enable developers to communicate using widely recognized and comprehensible terms for software interactions. Over time, common design patterns can be refined, rendering them more robust compared to improvised design approaches. Design patterns can be categorized into several different types based on their primary purpose and the problems they solve. Here are some of the most well-known design pattern categories: Creational Patterns These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, abstracting the process of object instantiation. Common creational patterns include: Singleton Pattern : Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Factory Method Pattern : Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Abstract Factory Pattern : Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Structural Patterns These patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures. They help in defining how objects and classes can be combined to form more complex structures. Common structural patterns include: Adapter Pattern : Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. Decorator Pattern : Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Composite Pattern : Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients can treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Behavioral Patterns These patterns focus on the communication between objects, defining how they interact and distribute responsibilities. Common behavioral patterns include: Observer Pattern : Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Strategy Pattern : Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. Command Pattern : Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. Chain of Responsibility Pattern : Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without the sender needing to know which object will handle it. Architectural Patterns These are higher-level patterns that guide the overall structure and organization of software systems. Examples include: Model-View-Controller (MVC) : Separates an application into three interconnected components - Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (user input handling). Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) : An architectural pattern often used in GUI-based applications, similar to MVC but tailored for modern UI frameworks. Concurrency Patterns Concurrency patterns address multi-threading and concurrent programming challenges. Examples include the \"Thread Pool\" and \"Producer-Consumer\" patterns. Anti-Patterns While not traditional design patterns, anti-patterns describe common mistakes or pitfalls in software design and development. Recognizing and avoiding these anti-patterns is crucial for writing maintainable and efficient code.

Patterns There are several patterns to implement a retry mechanism in your system. All of this can be mixed together, depending on your needs. In-place retry It is a very simple solution to implement. Essentially, consumer retry again to process the event after a certain amount of time. Backoff time can be applied, either linear or exponential. This approach have two main side effect. One is that the consumer is blocked. And second, when an error is persistent, retry wont't work and all messages will be retried, affecting consumer's performance. Decoupled retry While processing an error of a message, add message to a retry topic/queue. A retry consumer can read from there, tracking retry attempts using message headers. This approach doesn't block the main consumer.

The object will appear to change its class at runtime, specially when yo have multiple conditional statements that switch the object behavior based on its state. You can add new states to your system without altering existing code. Key components Context : The object that has a current state, delegating all state-specific work to this object. State : interface defining the behavior associated with a particular state of the context. Concrete State : classes that implement the State interface, defining the behavior associated with a particular state of the context. Example Let's consider a traffic light system with three states: Red , Yellow , and Green . from abc import ABC, abstractmethod # State interface class TrafficLightState(ABC): @abstractmethod def change(self): pass # Concrete states class RedLight(TrafficLightState): def change(self): return \"Yellow\" class YellowLight(TrafficLightState): def change(self): return \"Green\" class GreenLight(TrafficLightState): def change(self): return \"Red\" # Context class TrafficLight: def __init__(self): self.state = RedLight() def change(self): self.state = { RedLight: YellowLight(), YellowLight: GreenLight(), GreenLight: RedLight() }[type(self.state)] def current_state(self): return type(self.state).__name__ # Usage traffic_light = TrafficLight() print(traffic_light.current_state()) # Red traffic_light.change() print(traffic_light.current_state()) # Yellow traffic_light.change() print(traffic_light.current_state()) # Green traffic_light.change() print(traffic_light.current_state()) # Red Advantages Simplicity : It simplifies complex conditional statements by encapsulating state-specific behavior.

Depending on your needs, you can choose from several deployment strategies. But ideally, what you want is to deploy your application with zero downtime. This means that your application is always available to users, even when you are deploying new features or fixing bugs. Blue-green deployment In a blue-green deployment, you have two identical environments. One is the blue, which contains the current version of your application and it is serving real users. The other is green, which contains the new version deployed. Once validation is completed, you switch the router to point to the green environment and start sending user traffic to the environment. This way, you can deploy your application with zero downtime. Once the green environment is live, you can keep the blue environment as a backup, or terminate it to save costs. Canary deployment In a canary deployment, you deploy a new version of your application to a small group of users. This gives you a live environment where you can monitor and test the new app while minimizing the impact to the user base. If the canary deployment is successful, you can gradually increase the traffic to the new version until it is fully deployed. Rolling deployment In a rolling deployment, you gradually replace instances of the old version of your application with the new version. This continues until all instances are on the new version.

Declarative is where k8s take the lead regarding which are the actions needed to reach the desire state. Act -> observe -> diff -> Act or Desire vs Actual state k8s uses reconciliation to make the actual state looks like the desire state via control loop. Or by using imperative actions. k8s is usually the deployment tool for a microservices architecture, instead of monolithic application . Concepts Data is send to k8s through a yaml file, which is a declarative way to describe. Kind is equal to the object being described. Name must unique within the namespace for each Kind. spec information regarding this object representation. Create new or update resource with kubectl apply -f <file.yaml> Pod Can be reusable. It is a group of containers. It is the smallest unit in k8s. All containers for a pod will run in the same mode. They can talk to each other via localhost, and can share volume resources. A pod can have a container to run a web server application, where the code is located inside the image. But any time there is typo or a fix, it needs to build a new image and restart the container. This is called main container. Using side containers, we can have a shared volume between the main container to read the content from, separation od concern isolating and reusing. Each container can have different resources, like memory, cpu, etc. Services Load balancing for Pods. Use labels to determine target pods. Like a load balancer in front opf our pods. Service are not process running in k8s, is not consuming resources, is more like configuration or metadata. Deployments Deployments are an objects in k8s designed to avoid declaring the exact same pod metadata (except by the name, as it must be unique) when you need to deploy X instance of the same pod. Deployments does not create actually any pods, Instead, deployment create an object in the middle call replica sets.. Replica sets are used to make it easy to roll from one version of a deployment to another. Each time we update a deployment, a new replica set is created that contains the latest configuration. Replica set actually create the pods. Two type of strategies: RollingUpdate: value by default. new ReplicaSet is created, then scaled up as old one is scaled down. Recreate: remove all existing pods in the existing ReplicaSet before creating new ones from new ReplicaSet. Also, it is possible to configure another different deployment strategies . In a deployment, each endpoint is the IP address of a pod that is backing that service. In case of multiple replicas, we should see 1 endpoint for each pod created for a deployment. More configuration available in the official k8s documentation. StatefulSet It is an extension of deployment. It is used to manage stateful applications. Name is stable, unique pod identifiers and DNS names. Also, possible to set Persistent Storage and one Persistent Volume per VolumeClaim template. Stick to pod as long as the pod is declared. Pods created in asc order and deleted in desc order. It is possible to scale up, but all pods must be in Running or Read. Labels Characteristics are: map of key/value pairs, try to standardize both organizational and functional (selector on services) indexes and searchable avoid compound labels values Architecture Worker nodes, where the containers are running and application. They have cpu, memory to handle the application. Each of the have docker installed and kubelet , which mainly determine the url of the k8s cluster. Control planes nodes: host the components that actually run k8s. like API server. Data stored is in etcd. Scheduler, determine where to run the pods. Controller manager, watch the state of the cluster and make changes to the cluster to match the desire state. Cloud controller manager, manage the interaction with the underlying cloud provider. Networking Traffic can happen in a cluster within a pod, pod to pod, service to pods and external to cluster. within a pod: containers within a pod can connect to each other using localhost. Containers share an IP address accessible throughout the cluster and share common port space. pod to pod: each pod has a unique IP address, so they can communicate with each other. IP address are routable anywhere within the cluster. Not common procedure. service to pod: service is a resource that provides layer-4 load balancing for a group of pods. Service discovery using the cluster's internal DNS. Types are: ClusterIP (virtual IP address that load balance request to backend pods, accessible only in the cluster). NodePort: used for external facing service, exposing a port to access externally. K8s will open the port in each worker node. external to cluster: service type LoadBalancer, external IP address is provisioned by the cloud provider. Creates and manages an external load balancer, managing traffic across all nodes. Another option is Ingress . It is a layer-7 load balancer. It is a resource that balance the traffic for one or more services. Ingress rules to balance traffic to specific service. An Ingress may be configured to give Services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL / TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting. An Ingress controller is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress, usually with a load balancer, though it may also configure your edge router or additional frontends to help handle the traffic. Same rules as Nginx or Traefic can be applied to Ingress, meaning that traffic to a domain or a specific path can be redirect to the corresponding labelled service. Resource organization Have multiple clusters, to have highest level of isolation. Each cluster can have different purposes, like security, environments (development vs uat vs production), by geography... Namespaces are a grouping in k8s. There is no nesting, all our objects in k8s go to same namespace. Namespaces are a way to organize and isolate resources. Names of resources must be unique within a namespace. Security and access can be set per namespaces. Usually 1 namespace per project. kubeconfig It a file that contains all sections for k8s. clusters: url of the API service. Name can be use later for the kubeconfig file. context: where cluster, user and name are glue together. Names are used to identify the context. users: credentials to use to access the cluster. Name can be use later for the kubec config file. Volume It is a way to persist data. It is a directory that is accessible to containers. Volumes are exposed at pod level. By default, containers in a pod write to ephemeral storage (emptyDir), only available during the pod's lifecycle. Once pod is terminated, data is lost. But we can attach Persistent volumes to pods which persist any data written to them. They are network attached storage, independent of pod's life. We can static or dynamic volumes. Static volumes are created manually, dynamic volumes are created automatically when a pod is created. Storage is actually outside the cluster. I your k8s manifest, you will define what are your needs with a Persist Volume Claim. Then, when the request reaches the cluster, it will be matched with a Persist Volume (binding). If there is no match, it will create a new one. Secrets and dynamic configuration All runtime configuration should be able to be injected and overrides. Defaults are ok, but we should be able to override them. Secrets are a way to store sensitive information, like passwords, tokens, keys... They are stored in etcd, encrypted at rest. They are base64 encoded, but not encrypted. We can either provide defaults value if no configuration is provided or required configuration, where startup fails if no configuration is provided. ConfigMap is the object to store configuration. It is a key/value pair. Use to store configuration data and properties. We can load all keys (envFrom.configMapRef) or individual keys (env.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef) as environment variables. Another option is to mount the config map as a mounted volume, similar all keys or individual keys (changes don\u00b4t require restart). For sensitive information, Secret resource stores this kind of data. Must be Base64 encode, and they can be exposed to pod via environment variables or mounted volumes (optional, other secret mechanism system). Network policies Specification of how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other or other network endpoints. Use of labels to select pods and define rules which specify what traffic is allowed to the selected pods. By default, traffic is allowed by default. A pod become isolated when defining a network policy that selects them in the namespace. Other pods within the namespace will continue to receive traffic, unless a network policy is defined for them. Workloads A Job is a resource that runs to completion, ensure it completes or retries. Based on pod, and job and pod resources will remain so logs, output can be reviewed. Manually clean up actions are required. Possible to create parallel jobs too. Use cases are batch processing, data migration, backups, etc. some process that require large amount of data to process. Also, another interesting resource is Cronjobs. Schedules one or repeated a specific time or interval. It is based on job, so it is a pod. It is a way to automate recurrent tasks. New Job resources are created for each run. By default, it will clean up Jobs, by default, keeping 3 successful and 1 failed jobs. Jobs should be idempotent. DaemonSet is a resources that ensures that all nodes run a copy of a pod. Usually used for cluster-wide logging and monitor agents. Security context To give a more restrictive access to the pod. It is a way to limit access of the users. Service account A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod, and maps to a ServiceAccount object. When you authenticate to the API server, you identify yourself as a particular user. There is a service account by default. Role-based access control Once a user is authenticated, we need to authorize the user to perform actions. a Role is a collection of permissions (rules). Roles are namespace specific . We can assign rules to groups, and users belongs to groups. A more flexible way to assign rules. With ClusterRole, we can assign rules to cluster-wide resources instead to restrict to a specific namespaces. Totally reusable across entire cluster. We assign to groups and user with RoleBinding object. It is namespace specific. Get subjects and roles, and bind them together. Similar, but for entire cluster, you have the object ClusterRoleBinding. There are some built-in roles, such as cluster-admin , admin , view and edit . Local k8s cluster minikube quickly sets up a local Kubernetes cluster on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Easy to install and start working. Install and run minikube to have a local cluster for k8s in local. If minikube is running, automatically context/namespace is updated to use then one's from minikube. If you are working with other k8s cluster, keep in mind this change. Always double-check for namespace or context before deploying to the cluster. To work with cluster outside local, either you stop minikube or change namespace. Careful, when you stop minikube, context/namespace are set to null, so your kube commands won't be pointing to any context. You need to explicitly set again context. minikube command is just a proxy of kubectl commands, with a different command format but doing the same underneath. Readiness and liveness, startup probes Kubernetes simply observes the pod's lifecycle and starts to route traffic to the pod when the containers move from the Pending to Succeeded state. That means, Kubernetes mark a pod as healthy and ready to get request as soon as this happens. But application may receive traffic before is actually ready, because it needs to make database connection or load some data. There is a gap between when the app is ready and when Kubernetes thinks is ready. Risk of receive traffic and return 500 errors. Similar case happens when Kubelet watches for application crashes and restarts the pod to recover. 3 different probes: Liveness probe, determines the health, and kills the pod if it fails the liveness check (deadlock situation, since the underlying process continues to run from Kubernetes's perspective). Readiness probes are used to let kubelet know when the application is ready to accept new traffic. It runs during the pod's entire lifecycle, to deal when the application is temporarily unavailable (wait for it to recover). Startup probes are similar to readiness probes but only executed at startup. They are optimized for slow starting containers or applications with unpredictable initialization processes. 3 different probe handlers: exec: run a command inside the container. Success if return code is 0. TCPSocket: TCP check , success if port is open and accepting connections. HTTPGet: invoke HTTP GET against url, success if 2XX or 3XX code. There are many options in the probe configuration, check in the official k8s documentation. Resource management Units in k8s have a different rate conversion, and different units for CPU and Memory (can be either base 2 or 10). Resource request is the minimum amount of resources that the container needs to work. Helps k8s to schedule the pod in a more efficient way. Only used for scheduling, if the sum of the resource requests less than the capacity of the node. On the other hand, we have resource limits. It is the maximum amount of resources that a pod can get. If exceed this limits, container might be terminated. It is a way to protect against a runaway app. References K8s courses k8s concepts k9s commands minikube handbook minikube/kubectl commands kubernetes probes liveness probes tips","title":"Kubernetes"},{"location":"devops/k8s/#kubernetes","text":"It is a high-disponiblity platform.

It is a critical aspect of managing and maintaining server infrastructure, especially in modern, complex, and distributed computing environments. Server observability helps organizations detect and diagnose issues, optimize performance, and ensure the reliability of their IT systems. Server observability is an essential practice in modern IT operations, especially for cloud-based and containerized environments, where servers and services are highly dynamic and interconnected. Logging Collecting and analyzing logs generated by: Server Application/ Services Logs: messages logged by your server code, databases, etc. System Logs: Generated by systems-level components like the operating system, disk errors, hardware devices, etc. Network Logs: Generated by routers, load balancers, firewalls, etc. They provide information about network activity like packet drops, connection status, traffic flow and more. Logs can provide detailed information about events, errors, and transactions, helping in troubleshooting and debugging issues. There are different log system out there, so better approach is to use a tool to standardize the output of the logs, such as Fluentd , an Open source data collector. Logs are collected in a central location, where they can be displayed. A good tool for this is Kibana , with ElasticSearch for data storage. Metrics A metric is a numerical measurement easily understandable by humans. It helps humans to understand the system's behavior and performance, from a technical and a business point of view. Gathering and analyzing various metrics is essential to find quickly if your system is behaving as expected. Metrics can include various performance indicators, such as: CPU utilization memory usage disk I/O bottleneck connectivity and performance (database, 3rd party services, cache...) network traffic and latency http request/response times error rates application-specific metrics (e.g., user sign-ups, transactions processed) These metrics provide a real-time view of the server's health and performance. Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It comes with a query language built-in, where powerful queries can be written to gain insight into the system's behavior. Alerts regarding this metrics can be send to another system like Sentry or Nagios . For metrics visualization, Grafana is a good option. How to use/analyze metrics Don't use averages, use percentiles. Average doesn't show the real picture of the system, because it can be skewed by a few outliers. For this reason, we use percentiles, like P50, P90, P99, etc. How to get the value, just by throwing out the bottom XX % of the points and looking the first point that remains. From a list of sorted latency times [20, 37, 45, 62, 850, 920], the average is 312.3ms. But the P50 is 62ms and the P90 is 920ms . This means that 50% of the requests are below 62ms and 90% of the requests are below 920ms. Set alarms. Manual look to metrics or schedule checks is not enough, specially if the system is quite big. You need to be notified when something goes wrong.For each metric, you should set a period to measure, a threshold (limit) and a grace period (in case error recover by itself) before triggering the alarm. You can also set Working Day Alarms, alarms that indicates early warning indicators. During a working day, people can look into the issue, but if same happens during night or weekend, no need to wake up people (until the alarm is critical). Adapt limits to cycles. It's not the same traffic during the day than during the night, or in load peaks (if you are a retailer, during Black Friday you should expect a lot of traffic). You should set different threshold for different situation (hour, day of the week, season...). Periodically review your metrics. The system is not static, it changes over time. You should review your metrics periodically to ensure they are still relevant and useful. If this process can be automated, better. Remember that not having metrics is as bad as a bad metric. If you don't have metrics, you can't know what is happening in your system. Create alarms to alert if metrics are not present. Tracing Tracing requests as they traverse through various components of a distributed system. Distributed tracing helps in identifying latency bottlenecks and understanding the flow of requests in a microservices architecture. Jaeger is an open source end-to-end distributed system to help tracing request within the system. To implement server observability effectively, organizations often use specialized tools and platforms, such as monitoring and observability solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and many others. These tools help in collecting, storing, analyzing, and visualizing the data needed to maintain and improve server performance and reliability.

It helps humans to understand the system's behavior and performance, from a technical and a business point of view. Gathering and analyzing various metrics is essential to find quickly if your system is behaving as expected. Metrics can include various performance indicators, such as: CPU utilization memory usage disk I/O bottleneck connectivity and performance (database, 3rd party services, cache...) network traffic and latency http request/response times error rates application-specific metrics (e.g., user sign-ups, transactions processed) These metrics provide a real-time view of the server's health and performance. Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It comes with a query language built-in, where powerful queries can be written to gain insight into the system's behavior.

From a list of sorted latency times [20, 37, 45, 62, 850, 920], the average is 312.3ms. But the P50 is 62ms and the P90 is 920ms . This means that 50% of the requests are below 62ms and 90% of the requests are below 920ms. Set alarms. Manual look to metrics or schedule checks is not enough, specially if the system is quite big. You need to be notified when something goes wrong.For each metric, you should set a period to measure, a threshold (limit) and a grace period (in case error recover by itself) before triggering the alarm. You can also set Working Day Alarms, alarms that indicates early warning indicators. During a working day, people can look into the issue, but if same happens during night or weekend, no need to wake up people (until the alarm is critical). Adapt limits to cycles. It's not the same traffic during the day than during the night, or in load peaks (if you are a retailer, during Black Friday you should expect a lot of traffic). You should set different threshold for different situation (hour, day of the week, season...). Periodically review your metrics. The system is not static, it changes over time. You should review your metrics periodically to ensure they are still relevant and useful. If this process can be automated, better. Remember that not having metrics is as bad as a bad metric. If you don't have metrics, you can't know what is happening in your system. Create alarms to alert if metrics are not present.","title":"How to use/analyze metrics"},{"location":"devops/observability/#tracing","text":"Tracing requests as they traverse through various components of a distributed system.

In other words, an algorithm that uses data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes or values. A machine learning model is a mathematical model is a software application that encapsulates a function to calculate an output value based on one or more input values. The process of defining that function is known as training . After the function has been defined, you can use it to predict new values in a process called inferencing . Process Training data : Consists of a set data from past observations. It includes the observed attributes or features ( x ) and the known values or labels ( y ). An algorithm is applied to the data to determine the relationship between the features and the labels. The result of the algorithm is a model that can be used to predict new values ( y = f(x) ). This process of training a model involves multiple iterations in which you use an appropriate algorithm to train a model, evaluate the model's predictive performance, and refine the model by repeating the training process with different algorithms and parameters until you achieve an acceptable level of predictive accuracy. Training phase is now complete, so, the trained model can be used to predict new values in a process called inferencing . As the output of the model is a prediction, it is not guaranteed to be correct. It can be represented as a \u0177 . You can compare the known labels in the validation dataset to the labels that the model predicted. Then aggregate the differences between the predicted and actual label values to calculate a metric that indicates how accurately the model predicted for the validation data. Supervised Learning Is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, we know the correct output for each example in the training dataset. The model learns to map the input to the output. Depending on the type of output, supervised learning can be divided into: Regression The output return by the model is a numeric value. You can apply linear regression as the algorithm to train the model, which works by deriving a function that produces a straight line through the intersections of the x and y values while minimizing the average distance between the line and the plotted points. You can create a visual representation of the linear regression model to see how well the model fits the data. The line that the model generates is called the regression line. The distance between the regression line and the actual data points is called the residuals. The goal of linear regression is to minimize the residuals. The smaller the residuals, the better the model fits the data. But how good is the model? You can evaluate the model's performance by using the validation dataset and compare the predicted values ( \u0177 ) with the actual values ( y ). You can plot the predicted values against the actual values to see how well the model fits the data. And also, evaluate the model's efficiency with metrics like: Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute errors between the predicted and actual values. Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared errors between the predicted and actual values. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the average of the squared errors between the predicted and actual values. Coefficient of Determination (R\u00b2): The proportion of the variance in the validation results (R\u00b2 = 1- \u2211(y-\u0177)\u00b2 \u00f7 \u2211(y-y\u0304)\u00b2). Value between 0 and 1. The close value is to 1, the better the model is fitting the validation data. Binary classification The output is a binary value (true/false). The algorithm calculate the probability for class assignment (true/false). To train the model, there are many algorithms to use. One of the most common is logistic regression , which derives a sigmoid function that maps the input values to a probability value between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that produces an S-shaped curve. When representing the sigmoid function, the x-axis represents the input values, and the y-axis represents the probability values. The sigmoid function produces a curve that starts at 0 when x is negative infinity and ends at 1 when x is positive infinity. The curve is steepest at x = 0, where the probability is 0.5. The diagram includes an horizontal line to indicate the threshold value that separates the two classes. For any values at this point or above, the model will predict true (1); while for any values below this point it will predict false (0). To evaluate the model, you can use the validation dataset to compare the predicted values with the actual values. Usually, by creating a matrix called confusion matrix that shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. \u0177=0 and y=0: True negatives (TN) \u0177=1 and y=0: False positives (FP) \u0177=0 and y=1: False negatives (FN) \u0177=1 and y=1: True positives (TP) With this matrix, you can calculate metrics like: Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions to the total number of predictions: (TN+TP) \u00f7 (TN+FN+FP+TP). Recall: The proportion of true positives to the total number of actual positives: TP \u00f7 (TP+FN). Also call true positive rate (TPR). False positive rate (FPR): contrary as above metric. It is calculated as FP \u00f7(FP+TN). Precision: The proportion of true positives to the total number of predicted: TP \u00f7 (TP+FP). F1 score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall: 2 \u00d7 (Precision \u00d7 Recall) \u00f7 (Precision + Recall). Area Under the Curve (AUC): The area under the curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity), comparing the model's performance at different threshold . The ROC curve for a perfect model would go straight up the TPR axis on the left and then across the FPR axis at the top. Multi-class classification The output predicted is a value from a set of possible values. It follows the same process as binary classification, but the output is a value from a set of possible values. To train a model for multi-class classification, you can use an algorithm to fit the training data to a function that calculates a probability value for each possible class. There are two kinds of algorithm you can use to do this: One-vs-Rest (OvR) algorithms: trains a function for each class, predicting the probability of that class against all the other classes. Each algorithm produces a sigmoid function that maps the input values to a probability value between 0 and 1. And the model trained using this algorithm will predict the output class with the highest probability. Multinomial algorithms: creates a single functions that returns a multi-class probability distribution. The output of the model is a vector of probabilities that contains the probability distribution for all classes. No matter the algorithm you choose, the the model returns the most probable class. You can evaluate the model's performance by using similar metrics as binary classification, but you can use a confusion matrix with more rows and columns (one for each class). Same metrics as binary classification can be used to evaluate the model's. You can calculate the accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and AUC for each class. Additionally, you can calculate the overall values for the entire table. Unsupervised Learning Is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset . The model learns to identify patterns in the data and group similar data together. Clustering is a common unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data into discrete clusters. One algorithm you can use to train a model for clustering is the K-means , consisting in the following steps: The feature x values are vectors in a n-dimensional space, where n is the number of features. Define the number of clusters (k) you want to group. Then, k points are randomly selected as the center of the cluster, as the initial centroids. Each point is assigned to the nearest centroid, creating k clusters. Each centroid is recalculated as the mean of all the points in the cluster. After the centroids are recalculated, the points are reassigned to the nearest centroid. The process is repeated until the centroids no longer change, or the maximum number of iterations is reached. Since there is no labeled data, you can't evaluate the model's performance using the same metrics as supervised learning. Instead, you can use the following metrics: Average distance to cluster center: on average, how close is each point in the cluster is to the centroid of the cluster. Average distance to other center: on average, how close is each point in the cluster is to the centroid of all other clusters. Maximum distance to cluster center: the furthest distance between a point in the cluster and its centroid. Silhouette: A value between -1 and 1 that summarizes the ratio of distance between points in the same cluster and points in different clusters (The closer to 1, the better the cluster separation).

One algorithm you can use to train a model for clustering is the K-means , consisting in the following steps: The feature x values are vectors in a n-dimensional space, where n is the number of features. Define the number of clusters (k) you want to group. Then, k points are randomly selected as the center of the cluster, as the initial centroids. Each point is assigned to the nearest centroid, creating k clusters. Each centroid is recalculated as the mean of all the points in the cluster. After the centroids are recalculated, the points are reassigned to the nearest centroid. The process is repeated until the centroids no longer change, or the maximum number of iterations is reached. Since there is no labeled data, you can't evaluate the model's performance using the same metrics as supervised learning. Instead, you can use the following metrics: Average distance to cluster center: on average, how close is each point in the cluster is to the centroid of the cluster. Average distance to other center: on average, how close is each point in the cluster is to the centroid of all other clusters. Maximum distance to cluster center: the furthest distance between a point in the cluster and its centroid. Silhouette: A value between -1 and 1 that summarizes the ratio of distance between points in the same cluster and points in different clusters (The closer to 1, the better the cluster separation).","title":"Unsupervised Learning"},{"location":"machine-learning/fundamentals/#references","text":"Machine Learning Fundamentals","title":"References"},{"location":"machine-learning/input-data/","text":"Input data In order to train a machine learning model, you need to provide it with input data.

Where and how is the data coming from, how is it collected, and how is it stored. It is important to understand the data, the raw material. First phase is to analyze the data, confirm data is heterogeneous, diverse and with quality. The data can come from many different sources, such as databases, APIs, or events. Data preprocessing Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for training the model. Optimizing the data for the model, by removing duplicates, handling missing values, coherence and normalize the data. Registry how the data is cleaned and transformed, so that it can be reproduced and used in the future. This can include things like data validation, transformation... Dataset versioning is important, to keep track of the different versions of the data and how they are used in the model. Tools like MLFlow can help with this. Feature engineering Select the features that are going to be used in the model. It is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from the data. This can involve selecting, modifying, or creating new features that will help the model learn better. Things like the importance of the features, how they are going to be used in the model, defining the weights of the features when making the inference. Also, categorizing the data, so that the model can process it correctly (models works better with numbers rather than strings). Again, registry and versioning the features is vital that are going to be used by the model, so that they can be reproduced and used in the future. hyperparameters are parameters set before the training process begins and are not learned from the data. Model training Same logic that applies to the training has to be applied to the inference in production. It must be the same distribution of data. Classic models are deterministic. The model is not going to work the same way if the data is not the same. Other models are probabilistic, like neural networks. The model is going to work the same way, but the predictions are going to be different. A model cannot do predictions of what it has not seen. Some models/algorithms are: decision trees random forest linear regression neural networks More common frameworks for training the models are: scikit-learn tensorflow pytorch Model evaluation Evaluate the model to see how well it is performing. This can include metrics and other things like: accuracy precision recall F1 score auc confusion matrix The interpretability on ML models is the ability to understand how a complex model takes their decisions.

SHAP: SHapley Additive exPlanations is a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects game theory with local explanations, providing a way to understand the contribution of each feature to the final prediction. Production/model deployment Not only the model, but the whole process of deploying the solution in production. How the inference is going to be done, where the model is going to be stored, how to registry the inference, how is exposed the model (api, events...)

With the registry predictions of the model yo are able to evaluate the model at any time and prevent model drift. data drift: when the input data changes or the distribution of the data changes. concept drift: when it is a change between the input and output data. model drift: degradation of the model over time. covariate shift: when properties of the input data change between the training and testing phases of a model.

It is a nice tool to share information internally and externally. People knows in which stage is the project, are, what kind of response are expected... everything is shared in a common place visible for everyone involved in the project. Contracts are available (and testable). Even if code underneath is not fully ready, contracts are and will (should) not change whatsoever. OpenAPI description should be committed to source control, and, in fact, they should be among the first files to be committed. From there, they should also participate in Continuous Integration processes. Make the OpenAPI Documents Available to the Users. Beautifully-rendered documents can be very useful for the users of an API, but sometimes they might want to access the source OpenAPI description. For instance, to use tools to generate client code for them, or to build automated bindings for some language. Therefore, making the OpenAPI documents available to the users is an added bonus for them. The document can even be made available through the same API to allow runtime discovery. No need to write document by hand, there are nice tools or even frameworks like FastAPI that generates OpenAPI specification on the fly. Approaches There are two main different approaches regarding OpenAPI implementation. Apply one of the approaches regarding the project needs. Use a Design-First Approach Without any line of code, start the API design. OpenAPI specification is created to show the structure of the API, and then code is implemented to match the specification. Some tools can automatically build boilerplate from OpenAPI specification. It can be slower, but if requirements are clear, it is a good starting point. Contracts will be available from the beginning, and models can be reused easily. Use a Code-First Approach API is implemented together with the code, and OpenAPI specification is created with code comments, annotation and description in it. It is faster, but can lead to changes in the contract (may not be an issue if the project is starting up).

Contracts are available (and testable). Even if code underneath is not fully ready, contracts are and will (should) not change whatsoever. OpenAPI description should be committed to source control, and, in fact, they should be among the first files to be committed. From there, they should also participate in Continuous Integration processes. Make the OpenAPI Documents Available to the Users. Beautifully-rendered documents can be very useful for the users of an API, but sometimes they might want to access the source OpenAPI description. For instance, to use tools to generate client code for them, or to build automated bindings for some language. Therefore, making the OpenAPI documents available to the users is an added bonus for them. The document can even be made available through the same API to allow runtime discovery.

Agile is a methodology that encourage fast inspection and adaptation. Encourage teamwork, self-organization, to delivery high quality software. Scrum differentiates from other frameworks by having a set of roles, artifacts and time boxes. Scrum is most often used to manage complex software and product development, using iterative and incremental practices. Scrum significantly increases productivity and reduces time to benefits relative to classic waterfall processes. Scrum Roles ScrumMaster Is responsible for running the process smoothly, for removing obstacles that impact productivity, and for organizing and facilitating the critical meetings. The ScrumMaster should maintain a constant awareness of the status of the project (its progress to date) relative to the expected progress, investigate and facilitate resolution of any roadblocks that hold back progress, and generally be flexible enough to identify and deal with any issues that arise. The ScrumMaster is not a manager, but a facilitator. Product Owner The Product Owner is the keeper of the requirements. The Product Owner provides the \"single source of truth\" for the Team, regarding requirements and their planned order of implementation. Also, in charge to determine the objective, of the sprint. Team Is a self-organizing and cross-functional group of people who do the hands-on work of developing and testing the product. Since the Team is responsible for producing the product, it must also have the authority to make decisions about how to perform the work. The Team is therefore self-organizing: Team members decide how to break work into tasks, and how to allocate tasks to individuals, throughout the Sprint. Scrum Artifacts Product Backlog Board where are gather all the requirements of the project. It is a living document, that can be updated at any time. It is a list of features, bugs, technical work or knowledge acquisition. Sprint Backlog List of items to be tackled during a sprint. It is a subset of the Product Backlog. Agreed by the Team and the Product Owner in the planning session. Scrum Events Daily Meeting With a duration of no more of 15 minutes, Team owns the meeting and should speak in order to comment what is the plan for today, focus on meeting the objective of the Sprint. Avoid doing reporting, discussion should be based on the objective of the sprint, as Daily is not a status meeting. Raise if there are any blockers in the near future. Refinement session Meeting to decide what are the tasks planed for the next sprint, so during sprint there is no mismatch. Discussion can happens at this stage, but it should be as clear for everyone. Clear Acceptance Criteria from the business point of view, adding value to the project. It should be handle before the start next sprint. Planning session Where estimation of tickets come to place. Define and confirm the Goal for the sprint. Goal should be always be achievable. Review the capacity of the Team. Just before sprint is started. Review session With stakeholder and after sprint. Show delivery, progress and value added during the sprint. Retro session Discussion about what happened in last sprint. It is a safe space to talk about what went wrong, and how process can be improved. Other Concepts User stories/Use cases Description of a feature in a narrative form. Written by the Product Owner, and responsibility of the same to keep up-to-date. The elements in this User Story are: Name: The Name is a descriptive phrase or sentence. The example uses a basic \"Role-Action-Reason\" organization. It is important to have workable standard of some kind. Description: This is a high-level (low-detail) description of the need to be met. For functional (user-facing) requirements, the description is put in narrative form. For non-functional requirements, the description can be worded in any form that is easy to understand. In both cases, the key is that the level of detail is modest, because the fine details are worked out during the implementation phase, in discussions between team members, product owners, and anyone else who is involved. (This is one of the core concepts of Scrum: Requirements are specified at a level that allows rough estimation of the work required to implement them, not in detail.) Screens and External Documents: If the Story requires user-interface changes (especially non-trivial ones), the Story should contain or link to a prototype of the changes. Any external documents required to implement the Story should also be listed. How to test: The implementation of a Story is defined to be complete if, and only if, it passes all acceptance tests developed for it. This section provides a brief description of how the story will be tested. As for the feature itself, the description of testing methods is short, with the details to be worked out during implementation, but we need at least a summary to guide the estimation process. Story Not all requirements for new development represent user-facing features, but do represent significant work that must be done. These requirements often, but not always, represent work that must be done to support user-facing features. We call these non-functional requirements Technical Stories. Technical Stories have the same elements as User Stories, but need not be cast into narrative form if there is no benefit in doing so. Technical Stories are usually written by Team members, and are added to the Product Backlog. The Product Owner must be familiar with these Stories, and understand the dependencies between these and User Stories in order to rank (sequence) all Stories for implementation. Defect A Defect, or bug report, is a description of a failure of the product to behave in the expected fashion. Defects are stored in a bug-tracking system, which may or may not be physically the same system used to store the Product Backlog. If not, then someone (usually the Product Owner) must enter each Defect into the Product Backlog, for sequencing and scheduling. Sprint Fixed time duration to accomplish an agreed objective, with value by the Team, which can be potentially be deliver to production/final stage. Usually 2 weeks. Story Points Measurement of effort of a certain Story. experience, complexity and load of work are taken into account. It must be taken by the Team. Objective, is to have an agreement of the effort of the Story. TL usually explain task to the team, doubts are solved. TL is not the one who decided, but Team. Notes are taken. Once is clear, values from a Fibonacci sequence are assigned to the Story. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. 1 is the lowest effort, 21 is the greatest effort. More than 21, should be split in smaller User Stories. Discuss with team regarding any particular difference on estimation, and agreed the effort. Personal experience Not everything is closed at the beginning of the sprint. Flexibility to learn. Focus on objective of the sprint, complete task and give value to the product. Communication is key. It is not about the person, is the Team. References Agile manifesto What is Scrum? How it works?

Time-based one-time password (TOTP) It is an algorithm that generates a one time password based on the current time and a shared secret key. It is widely used in two-factor authentication (2FA) systems. Both client and server must share the secret key. The client generates the code based on the current time and the shared secret key, and sends it to the server. The server then generates their own code, and compares it with the code sent by the client. If they match, the authentication is successful. TOTP codes works only for certain period of time, usually 30 seconds. After that, the code is no longer valid and a new one is generated. Oauth 2.0 It is a protocol for authorization, to enable 3pp applications to obtain limited access to a HTTP service. When trying to access a protected resource, the client must present an access token to the server. The token is issued by an authorization server, after a successful login. Then, the client uses the token to access protected resources by including it in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header of HTTP requests. When a client makes a request, server side does couple of checks of the token. Check if the token is valid (correct structure, format, content and token is not expired...) and verified (signature is using expected algorithm, issuer and audience claims are the expected), the server grants access to the requested resource. It returns an error status code otherwise. Aside from access tokens, refresh tokens can also be issued. They are used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires, without requiring the user to log in again. Tokens are credentials, so they need to be treated with care. Scopes can be associated to the token, to limit the access to certain resources. Keycloak and Okta are popular identity providers that support OAuth2. JWT JWT is an authentication mechanism used in OAuth 2.0 to transmit information via JSON objects in a secure way. Used to authenticate user in web applications, specially REST APIs. The information is digitally signed, so it can be verified and trusted. A JWT token is composed by three parts, encoded using Base64Url and concatenated with dots. Header : contains data about the token, like the algorithm used to sign it and the type of token. Payload : contains the claims, which are statements about an entity.

It can be implemented at any layer of an infrastructure, from the database, application, gateway, or even the client side. How it works A cache works as a temporary storage for data that are frequently accessed or can be reused multiple times. When a requests is made, the system first checks if the item requested is in the cache. If it is ( cache hits ), the data is retrieved from the cache, which is much faster than fetching it from the original source (database, API, etc.). If the item is not in the cache ( cache miss ), it is fetched from the original source, stored in the cache for future requests, and then returned to the requester. Advantages Speed : Accessing data from a cache is significantly faster than retrieving it from the original source. Reduced Load : Accessing data from a cache reduces the load of the original data source, improving the performance. Cost Efficiency : Using cache reduces the number of requests to the original data. Error Tolerance : In case the original data source is temporarily unavailable, cached data can still be served. Disadvantages Staleness : Cached data may become outdated if the original data changes, leading to potential inconsistencies. Memory Usage : Caches consume memory, which can be a limitation in resource-constrained environments. Complexity : Implementing and managing a cache adds complexity to the system, including the need for cache invalidation strategies. Types of Cache In-Memory Cache : Data is stored in the RAM of the server, providing extremely fast access times. Examples include Redis and Memcached. Distributed Cache : A cache that is shared across multiple servers or instances, allowing for scalability and high availability. Examples include Amazon ElastiCache and Apache Ignite. Client-Side Cache : Data is stored on the client side, such as in browsers or mobile devices, to reduce latency and improve user experience. Invalidation Strategies Cache invalidation is the process of removing or updating data in the cache, to make sure data is up-to-date. Common strategies include: Time-Based Expiration : Entries are automatically removed from the cache after a specified time period (TTL - Time To Live). Manual Invalidation : Entries are explicitly removed or updated by the application, specially when original data is modified/removed. Least Recently Used (LRU) : The least recently accessed items are removed when the cache reaches its capacity. Cache Database Strategies One common scenario to use cache is to reduce queries to a database. See below common strategies: Write-Through : When data is written, is written to both cache and database at the same time. Write-Back : Data is written to the cache first, and then asynchronously to the database. Write-Around : Data is written to the database.Only a cache miss will cause data to be available in the cache. Read-Through : When data is requested, the cache is checked first. If the data is not found, it is fetched from the database and stored in the cache. Cache-Aside : Manage by the application. It is responsible for loading data into the cache on a cache miss, and for updating or invalidating the cache when data is modified. It requires more effort to implement, but provides more control over when data is cached and when it is removed. Keep in mind that these strategies may not be natively supported by your database and may require additional implementation in your application logic.

UUIDs UUIDS are a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify objects in a computer. In a database, UUIDs can be used as primary keys for tables. But the are some issues to take a look at: Performance : to organize indexes, the database needs to sort the data. This is a problem when using UUIDs because they are not sequential. Storage : UUIDs are 128 bits long, which is more than the 32 bits used by by auto-incrementing IDs. In a large database, this can lead to a significant amount of storage. On the other hand, UUIDs are unique across different databases and can be generated in different machines without the need to coordinate with each other. Auto-incrementing IDs Auto-incrementing IDs are a good choice for primary keys in a database. They are sequential and can be used to organize indexes quickly and efficiently.

It helps to match, find or manage text. Start by typing OK in the Regex field to proceed to the first step and access the more detailed description. What is Regular Expressions Regex? Regular Expressions are a string of characters that express a search pattern. Often abbreviated as Regex or Regexp. It is especially used to find or replace words in texts. In addition, we can test whether a text complies with the rules we set. For example, let's say you have a list of filenames. And you only want to find files with the pdf extension. Following typing an expression ^\\w+\\.pdf$ will work. The meaning of the definitions in this expression will become clearer as the steps progress. Basic Matchers The character or word we want to find is written directly. It is similar to a normal search process. For example, to find the word curious in the text, type the same. The period . allows selecting any character, including special characters and spaces. Character Sets [abc] If one of the characters in a word can be various characters, we write it in square brackets [] with all alternative characters. For example, to write an expression that can find all the words in the text, type the characters a, e, i, o, u adjacently within square brackets [] . Negated Character Sets [^abc] To find all words in the text below, except for ber and bor, type e and o side by side after the caret ^ character inside square brackets [] . Character Sets: Alphanumeric Range Letter Range [a-z] To find the letters in the specified range, the starting letter and the ending letter are written in square brackets [] with a dash between them - . It is case-sensitive. Type the expression that will select all lowercase letters between e and o , including themselves. Character Sets: Digit Range Number Range [0-9] To find the numbers in the specified range, the starting number and the ending number are written in square brackets [] with a dash - between them. Write an expression that will select all numbers between 3 and 6, including themselves. Repetitions Some special characters are used to specify how many times a character will be repeated in the text. These special characters are the plus + , the asterisk * , and the question mark ? . Repetitions: Asterisk Asterisk * We put an asterisk * after a character to indicate that the character may either not match at all or can match many times. For example, indicate that the letter e should never occur in the text, or it can occur once or more side by side. Repetitions: The Plus Plus Sign + To indicate that a character can occur one or more times, we put a plus sign + after a character. For example, indicate that the letter e can occur one or more times in the text. Repetitions: The Question Mark Question Mark ? To indicate that a character is optional, we put a ? question mark after a character. For example, indicate that the following letter u is optional. Repetitions: Curly Braces To express a certain number of occurrences of a character, we write curly braces {n} along with how many times we want it to occur at the end. For example, indicate that the following letter e can occur only 2 times. To express at least a certain number of occurrences of a character, we write the end of the character at least how many times we want it to occur, with a comma , at the end, and inside curly braces {n, } . For example, indicate that the following letter e can occur at least 3 times. To express the occurrence of a character in a certain number range, we write curly braces {x,y} with the interval we want to go to the end. For example, indicate that the following letter e can only occur between 1 and 3. Grouping Parentheses ( ): Grouping We can group an expression and use these groups to reference or enforce some rules. To group an expression, we enclose () in parentheses. For now just group haa below. Group References Referencing a Group The words ha and haa are grouped below. The first group is used by writing \\1 to avoid rewriting. Here 1 denotes the order of grouping. Type \\2 at the end of the expression to refer to the second group. Non-capturing Grouping Parentheses (?: ) : Non-capturing Grouping You can group an expression and ensure that it is not captured by references. For example, below are two groups. However, the first group reference we denote with \\1 actually indicates the second group, as the first is a non-capturing group. Pipe Character | It allows to specify that an expression can be in different expressions. Thus, all possible statements are written separated by the pipe sign | . This differs from charset [abc] , charsets operate at the character level. Alternatives are at the expression level. For example, the following expression would select both cat and Cat. Add another pipe sign | to the end of the expression and type rat so that all words are selected. ### Escape Character \\ There are special characters that we use when writing regex. { } [ ] / \\ + * . $^ | ? Before we can select these characters themselves, we need to use an escape character \\ . For example, to select the dot . and asterisk * characters in the text, let's add an escape character \\ before it. Start of The String Caret Sign ^ : Selecting by Line Start. We were using [0-9] to find numbers. To find only numbers at the beginning of a line, prefix this expression with the ^ sign. End of The String Dollar Sign $ : Selecting by End of Line. Let's use the $ sign after the html value to find the html texts only at the end of the line. Alphanumeric Word Character \\w : Letter, Number and Underscore The expression \\w is used to find letters, numbers and underscore characters. Let's use the expression \\w to find word characters in the text. Non-alphanumeric Except Word Character \\W The expression \\W is used to find characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores. Digits Number Character \\d \\d is used to find only number characters. Non-digits Except Number Character \\D \\D is used to find non-numeric characters. Whitespace Characters Space Character \\s \\s is used to find only space characters. Non-whitespace Characters Except Space Character \\S \\S is used to find non-space characters. Lookaround If we want the phrase we're writing to come before or after another phrase, we need to \"lookaround\". Take the next step to learn how to \"lookaround\". Lookaround: Positive Lookahead Positive Lookahead: (?=) For example, we want to select the hour value in the text. Therefore, to select only the numerical values that have PM after them, we need to write the positive look-ahead expression (?=) after our expression. Include PM after the = sign inside the parentheses. Lookaround: Negative Lookahead Negative Lookahead: (?!) For example, we want to select numbers other than the hour value in the text. Therefore, we need to write the negative look-ahead (?!) expression after our expression to select only the numerical values that do not have PM after them. Include PM after the ! sign inside the parentheses. Lookaround: Positive Lookbehind Positive Lookbehind: (?<=) For example, we want to select the price value in the text. Therefore, to select only the number values that preceded by $ , we need to write the positive lookbehind expression (?<=) before our expression. Add \\$ after the = sign inside the brackets. Lookaround: Negative Lookbehind Negative Lookbehind: (?<!) For example, we want to select numbers in the text other than the price value. Therefore, to select only numeric values that are not preceded by $ , we need to write the negative lookbehind (?<!) before our expression. Add \\$ after the ! inside the brackets. Flags Flags change the output of the expression. That's why flags are also called modifiers. Determines whether the typed expression treats text as separate lines, is case sensitive, or finds all matches. Continue to the next step to learn the flags. Flags: Global The global flag causes the expression to select all matches. If not used it will only select the first match. Now enable the global flag to be able to select all matches. /g all matches Flags: Multiline Regex sees all text as one line. But we use the multiline flag to handle each line separately. In this way, the expressions we write according to the end of the linework separately for each line. Now enable the multiline flag to find all matches. /m multiline Flags: Case Insensitive In order to remove the case-sensitiveness of the expression we have written, we must activate the case-insensitive flag. /i case insensitive Greedy Matching Regex does a greedy match by default. This means that the matchmaking will be as long as possible. Check out the example below. It refers to any match that ends in r and can be any character preceded by it. But it does not stop at the first letter r . Lazy Matching Lazy matchmaking, unlike greedy matching, stops at the first matching. For example, in the example below, add a ? after * to find the first match that ends with the letter r and is preceded by any character. It means that this match will stop at the first letter r .

It is a way to ensure that the code is working as expected and to catch any bugs that may have been introduced before going to a live environment and affect the final user. It can be either manual or automated. Manual tests are usually done by people vs automated tests are done by machines. No matter if you are in a small team or in a big company, testing is a must . We are human after all, and mistakes can happens. There are different types of tests, where each layer described is important to cover because each has its own purpose. The most common types of tests are: Unit test Cover the smallest piece of code, usually a function or a method. The goal is to test the code in isolation, without any dependencies. Making sure any changes in the code will not break the expected behavior. Test should be fast and deterministic (same result over and over). It should not depend on any external resource, such as a database, network, or file system. Coverage Coverage is a metric that measures the amount of code that is covered by tests. It generates a report showing which are the total lines of code, which are covered by tests and which are not. The higher the coverage, the better. But it is important to note that 100% coverage does not mean that the code is bug free. It only means that all lines are covered by tests. It is a good idea to check the coverage on your tests. If any line is not covered, means that test may not be completed or that the code is not being used, given you the opportunity to remove it. Mocking When testing logic that depends on external resources, such as a database or a external HTTP request, it is a good practice to mock the response. This way, the test is not dependent on the external resource, giving faster and deterministic tests. Fixtures Fixtures are a way to set up and tear down resources that are used in the tests. It is a way to avoid code repetition and to keep the tests clean, ensuring that data is consistent across all tests. Parametrized tests Parametrized tests are a way to run the same test with different inputs. Integration test Integration tests are used to test the interaction between different parts of the application. It is a way to ensure that the different parts are working together as expected. End-to-end test Tests the whole application against a live production-like server. It is a way to ensure that the application is working as expected from the user's perspective. Usually, it is done with a browser automation tool, such as Selenium. In case of an API, you can automate with Postman. If is not possible to automate, it can be done manually. These tests are slow and hard to create and maintain, but are important to ensure that the application is working as expected. Smoke test Smoke tests are a subset of end-to-end tests. They are used to ensure that the the most important features of the application are working as expected, preventing the application to be usable. Smoked tests have a limited scope, completed in a short time. Regression test Confirms that previously developed and tested features in an application still works correctly after any changes are introduced. Regression tests have wider scope and covers all areas in the application, taking longer to complete. Performance test Performance tests are testing methods to measure how the system behaves and performs under a particular load. Load test Load testing is the process of checking the behavior of the system under an anticipated load. Stress test The goal of stress testing is to identify the saturation point and the first bottleneck of the application under test. Once is identified, it is possible to patch that part of the system to avoid the bottleneck. Spike Tests Test the system's reaction to sudden and extreme changes in load.

It is a way to ensure that the code is working as expected and to catch any bugs that may have been introduced before going to a live environment and affect the final user. It can be either manual or automated. Manual tests are usually done by people vs automated tests are done by machines. No matter if you are in a small team or in a big company, testing is a must . We are human after all, and mistakes can happens. There are different types of tests, where each layer described is important to cover because each has its own purpose. The most common types of tests are:","title":"Testing"},{"location":"utils/testing/#unit-test","text":"Cover the smallest piece of code, usually a function or a method. The goal is to test the code in isolation, without any dependencies. Making sure any changes in the code will not break the expected behavior. Test should be fast and deterministic (same result over and over). It should not depend on any external resource, such as a database, network, or file system.","title":"Unit test"},{"location":"utils/testing/#coverage","text":"Coverage is a metric that measures the amount of code that is covered by tests. It generates a report showing which are the total lines of code, which are covered by tests and which are not. The higher the coverage, the better. But it is important to note that 100% coverage does not mean that the code is bug free. It only means that all lines are covered by tests. It is a good idea to check the coverage on your tests. If any line is not covered, means that test may not be completed or that the code is not being used, given you the opportunity to remove it.","title":"Coverage"},{"location":"utils/testing/#mocking","text":"When testing logic that depends on external resources, such as a database or a external HTTP request, it is a good practice to mock the response.
