    <h1 id="waterfall-methodology">Waterfall Methodology</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.projectmanager.com/guides/waterfall-methodology">Waterfall methodology</a>
is a linear project management, when requirements are defined at beginning. Task
are defined sequential in a project plan (Gantt Chart) to accommodate those
requirements</p>
<h2 id="the-phases-of-the-waterfall-model">The Phases of the Waterfall Model</h2>
<p>The waterfall approach has, at least, five to seven phases that follow in strict
linear order, where a phase canâ€™t begin until the previous phase has been
completed. The specific names of the waterfall steps vary, but they were
originally defined by its inventor, Winston W. Royce, in the following way:</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>The key aspect of the waterfall methodology is that all customer requirements
are gathered at the beginning of the project, allowing every other phase to be
planned without further customer correspondence until the product is complete.
It is assumed that all requirements can be gathered at this waterfall management
phase.</p>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>The design phase of the waterfall process is best broken up into two sub-phases:
logical design and physical design. The logical design sub-phase is when
possible solutions are brainstormed and theorized. The physical design sub-phase
is when those theoretical ideas and schemas are made into concrete
specifications.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>The implementation phase is when programmers assimilate the requirements and
specifications from the previous phases and produce actual code.</p>
<h3 id="verification">Verification</h3>
<p>This phase is when the customer reviews the product to make sure that it meets
the requirements laid out at the beginning of the waterfall project. This is
done by releasing the completed product to the customer.</p>
<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>
<p>The customer is regularly using the product during the maintenance phase,
discovering bugs, inadequate features and other errors that occurred during
production. The production team applies these fixes as necessary until the
customer is satisfied.</p>
