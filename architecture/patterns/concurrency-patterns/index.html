    <h1 id="concurrency-patterns">Concurrency Patterns</h1>
<p>Concurrent development is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the
performance of applications. However, it can also introduce a lot of complexity
and potential bugs. We will discuss some common concurrency patterns that can be
used to simplify concurrent development.</p>
<p>It is important to understand some concepts before diving into concurrency.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concurrency</strong>: The ability of a system to execute multiple tasks at the same
  time. CPU decides how to allocate resources to tasks, which can lead to tasks
  being executed in unpredictable order.</li>
<li><strong>Parallelism</strong>: an application divides tasks into smaller subtasks that can
  be executed in parallel, in different CPU cores. Tasks are executed
  simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about
 doing lots of things at once.</p>
<p>In Go, concurrency is achieved using goroutines and channels.</p>
<h2 id="worker-pool">Worker Pool</h2>
<p>Worker pools involve creating a fixed number of workers that process tasks from
a common queue.</p>
<p>This pattern is useful when you have a large number of tasks that need to be
processed concurrently, but you want to limit the number of workers (goroutines)
that are created.</p>
<h2 id="fan-out-fan-in">Fan-out, Fan-in</h2>
<p>Multiple workers can be used to process tasks concurrently, and the results can
be combined into a single channel.</p>
<h2 id="pipeline">Pipeline</h2>
<p>It involves a series of stages connected by channels. Each stage is a separate
goroutine that processes the data and passes it to the next stage.</p>
<h2 id="pubsub">Pub/Sub</h2>
<p>Allows messages to be published into more than one channel or topic. Then, each
subscriber can receive messages from the channel or topic they are interested
in.</p>
<h2 id="rate-limiting">Rate Limiting</h2>
<p>Controls the rate at which tasks are processed. It can be used to limit the of
requests sent to an external service.</p>
<h2 id="semaphore">Semaphore</h2>
<p>Limits the number of goroutines that can access a shared resource at the same
time. It is useful to control concurrent access to shared resources.</p>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
